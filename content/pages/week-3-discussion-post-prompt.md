1. Choose one or two passages from *The Analects*, *The Mencius*, or *The Xunzi* that you find interesting and/or confusing. Quote a brief sentence or two in your response and share what you think about it, or share some questions you have about the passage. 
2. Contrast the writing styles of *The Analects*, *The Mencius*, *The Great Learning*, or *The Xunzi.* What do these differing styles potentially tell us about the history of their compilation? Quote a brief sentence or two in your response. 
3. The early Confucians based their principled arguments on longstanding classical sources. Where do you see *The Classic of Documents*, *The Classic of Odes*, *The Zuo Commentary,* etc. in your readings this week? How do the Confucians (and/or their opponents) use those texts in their arguments?  Quote a brief sentence or two in your response. 
4. How did astronomy relate to history in the period under study? Quote a brief sentence or two in your response.
5. Select a poem from the *Book of Odes* and analyze its contents. Make sure you share the poem in your response.

\*\*Remember to also write 1–2 sentences in response to one of your classmates!
