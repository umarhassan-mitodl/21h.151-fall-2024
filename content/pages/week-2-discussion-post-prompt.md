**Please pick one question, write at least two paragraphs in response (in accordance with the guidelines for posts), and then also respond to one of your classmates (or** {{% resource_link "58beaa7f-2472-4ad4-b722-4322d3b34f89" "**ChatGPT**" %}}**) with 1–2 sentences.** 

1. What are some of the concerns of the Shang elite as reflected in the oracle bone inscriptions? Are any of their concerns surprising to you? 
2. What are the advantages/disadvantages of a character-based writing system versus an alphabetic-based writing system? 
3. What does "feudal" mean in the Zhou "feudal system"? Where else have you heard this term used? 
4. Pick one hexagram from the *Classic of Changes* and analyze it in light of this week's readings. Why do you think the hexagrams were written down and analyzed for posterity? How do we even know what they mean?
5. Are emojis a script in your view? Reflecting on the readings and lecture,  do you see any parallels between contemporary use of emojis, on the one hand, and Sumerian cuneiform (c. 3,500 BCE), Egyptian hieroglyphs (c. 3,200–3,250 BCE), Chinese oracle bone scripts during the reign of Wu Ding (c. 1,200 BCE), and Olmec/proto-Mayan (c. 650 BCE), on the other?
