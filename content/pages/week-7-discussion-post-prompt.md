Please respond to one of the following prompts and then respond to one of your classmates in 2–3 sentences. 

1. Select a tale from the *Extensive Records of the Taiping Era* and discuss what it reveals about the Tang as a historical era. 
2. Select an article from the *Great Tang Code* and discuss what it reveals about the Tang as a historical era. 
3. If you would like to read about China's first and only female emperor (Wu Zetian), read the secondary reading about the legitimization of her reign through appeals to religious figures. Do any of the tales in the *Extensive Records of the Taiping Era* or articles in the *Great Tang Code* shed light on how her tenure as emperor may have been possible? Discuss them in your post.
