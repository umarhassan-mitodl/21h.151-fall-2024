Respond to one of the following questions and then address one of your classmate's posts in 2–3 sentences: 

1. How was Taiwan understood by Chinese literati in the early Qing?
2. Read the description of the Yangzhou Massacre. If the Manchu conquest of China was so brutal (at times), why and how was it ultimately successful? 
3. Consider the descriptions of the Miao peoples and Boat peoples. How was ethnicity defined and understood during the Qing?
4. After reading the primary sources about Qing property, consider the "Great Divergence Debate" in academia. When did the divergence occur and what may have caused it?
5. How did China potentially influence the French Enlightenment during the 18th century?
