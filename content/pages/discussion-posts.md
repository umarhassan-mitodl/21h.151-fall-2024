**Discussion posts are mandatory.** They represent 20% of your final grade. You are required to complete ten postings over the semester. When properly written, each is worth 2 points. Late postings will be counted for 1 point. 

**Postings are due weekly**. 

The discussion posts are the major form of writing you will do this semester. You will answer a prompt about the week's primary source readings in **2 paragraphs of at least 3–5 sentences each**, and then comment on another classmate's post in **1–2 sentences**. The course TA and I will monitor the quality of the discussion posts and provide selective feedback over the semester. 

Some guidelines to follow: 

1. The quality of posting in terms of content and writing matters. If your responses are overly general, or generic, or appear to be taken from online or a chatbot, we will be forced to mark down the final posting grade following a preliminary warning and no improvement. 
2. Discussion posts should reference a specific section of a primary source from a given week, such as a quote from Confucius, a Tang poem, or a Song painting. You should avoid talking about "Tang Poetry" as a monolith in one paragraph, as there are over 49,000 surviving Tang poems. By being specific and precise, you will start thinking like a historian.
3. You may use the first person and share personal experiences in your postings as long as you follow the above instructions.
4. You should distinguish between (most objective--externally verifiable with the senses) **facts**, **inferences**, **judgments**, and **opinions** (most subjective--based on one's inner thoughts and experiences):

- **Facts:** Things that we know to be true based on evidence. *Ex: Bees make honey.*
- **Inferences:** Statements of the unknown based on the known, derived from reason. *Ex: Fire can actually contribute to the health of a forest.* (This observation can be inferred from examining historical records of forest cover). 
- **Judgments:** A statement we would expect others to agree with if they had the same information and perspective that we do; an "argument." *Ex: People shouldn’t build in places with wildfire risk.*
- **Opinion:** Preferences and feelings that aren't necessarily based on fact or knowledge. *Ex: I like taro ice cream.* 
- If you wish to share judgments and opinions in your postings, they must be in a separate paragraph from the paragraph detailing facts and inferences. **The structure of a proper discussion post is thus as follows:** 
- **Paragraph One:** A discussion of the question prompt based on facts and evidence (e.g., a quotation) and any inferences you made from the reading. 
- **Paragraph Two:** A discussion of your judgments and opinions about the readings that follows naturally from the first paragraph.
