## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

This course has no prerequisites and all MIT students are welcome to enroll. Non-enrolled guests (parents, siblings, friends, etc) are welcome, but **please let me know in advance** that they're coming as classroom space has sometimes been an issue in past terms. 

This course will be conducted in English and **Chinese language ability is not a prerequisite**.

I will provide primary sources in Chinese whenever possible because some of you may wish to count this class towards a Chinese Language Minor. **Please speak to me first if you want this class to count towards a minor in Chinese.** In most cases, I will instruct you to direct your attention to the Chinese materials provided, respond to them in the class discussion forum, and submit your final timeline project in written Chinese. 

## Course Description

With China playing a central role in global affairs today, an understanding of the country’s long and rich history has never been more important. In this class, we will trace the rise of the world’s first centralized bureaucratic state, the development of the world’s oldest living written culture, and the formation of the pre-modern world’s largest single commercial market. We will hear the voices of Chinese women and men as they founded dynasties, engaged in philosophy, composed literature, challenged orthodoxies, and invented technologies used around the globe. This class equips students to appreciate China’s past, understand the country’s present, and reflect on what its stories mean for the wider world.
